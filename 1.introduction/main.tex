\chapter{Introduction}

Composed by billions of interconnected neurons, the brain is the most complex
biological machine that we know. Understanding how brain connectivity is 
organized, and how this constrains brain functionality is one a key question
of neuroscience. Recent advances in acquisition and modeling techniques on
Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) have facilitated to estimate and
study axonal connectivity in vivo. In this thesis, we leverage recent advances
in dMRI and tractography algorithms in order to study: how brain's connectivity
is organized; how connectivity is related to anatomy and function; how to
find correspondences when the connectivity variates across people, and how to
infer connectivity in the presence of a brain's pathology. The thesis is
divided in three major contributions:

Our first contribution is a parsimonious model for the long-range axonal
connectivity (extrinsic connectivity), and an efficient technique to divide the
brain in regions with homogeneous connectivity~\cite{Gallardo2017a}. Our
connectivity model is based on histological results obtained in the macaque
brain, and accounts for the across-subject variability in the human brain
connectivity. Our parceling technique uses a hierarchical clustering approach,
letting us comprise multiple granularities of the same brain parcellation.
Also, our technique can create both single subject and groupwise parcellations
of the whole cortex, allowing to study brain connectivity at the single subject
and at the population level. While our technique is solely based on the brain's
structural connectivity, our resulting parcels are in agreement with anatomical,
structural and functional parcellations extant in the literature. Our technique
helps to lower the gap between structural connectivity and brain function, since
some of our pure structural parcels show good overlapping with responses to
functional tasks.

Our second contribution is a technique to find correspondence between
structural parcellations of different subjects~\cite{Gallardo2018}. Even when
produced by the same technique, parcellations tend to differ in the
number, shape, and spatial localization of parcels across subjects. Matching
these parcels across subjects is an open problem in neuroscience. To solve
it, we propose a parcel matching method based on Optimal Transport. We test its
performance on different parcellations, and compare it against state of the
art matching techniques. We show that our method achieves the highest number
of correct matches. Our technique could help to study properties of structurally
defined areas, when they do not have high spatial coherence across subjects.
Also, it could help to understand the link between different brain atlases, and
improve the comparisons of cortical areas between higher primates.

Our third contribution is a multi-atlas technique to infer the location of 
white-matter bundles in patients with a brain pathology~\cite{Guillermo2018}.
Lesions in the cortex or white matter disrupt the normal functioning of the
brain. Some white matter pathologies, such as tumors or traumatic brain injury,
hampers tractography, difficulting to infer which pathways are affected. We 
present a technique that infers the affected tracts by aggregating spatial
information from healthy subjects while taking into account the diffusion
information of the patient. In particular, we register the tracts of each
healthy subject to the patient, and make each healthy patient 'vote' for a
tract on each voxel of the DWI image of the patient. Our technique weights the
vote of each subject based on how the voted pathway is supported by the patient's 
diffusion data. This is, if the diffusion data of our patient is consistent with
the direction of the voted pathway, the vote has a higher weight. We show that
our technique achieves better results that using the simple voting.

%The human brain is the most complex biological machine known in the universe.
%The brain works as a complex network of billion of neurons.
%Since this is impossible to handle, we need to subdivide the brain.
%Depending how you look at it, the brain can be divided following many different criteria (cytho, function).
%In each one of these criteria, brain connectivity is quite important and consistent.
%We know this thanks to invasive stuff.
%Since our brain is the result of biological evolution, we tortured monkeys, cats and rats in order to study and understand it.
%We cannot do that anymore, so it's difficult to study brain connectivity.
%Diffusion MRI allows to study the brain invivo without inducing pain/problems.
%But it has strong limitations: resolution in time and space, directionality, etc.
%It has been used to divide the brain, but the techniques are not good enough.
%We don't know how many parcels we need, or how to do it.
%We propose a parcellation technique that solves many of these problems.
%We show it is consistent with function.
%Now we would like to use this to study brain connectivity and function in different subjects.
%However, an interesting problem is that, for some regions, as frontal cortex, there's a lot of across subject variability.
%Turns out that it's hard to match parcels across subjects.
%Spatial overlap does not work here because of [cite].
%We need to match stuff while imposing few constraints, specially spatial ones.
%The existing techniques are nice and simple, but not sufficient.
%We propose to improve the matching by using optimal transport.
%It actually works well.
%Now that we have a way to parcellate the brain, and a way to map that across subjects, maybe we can better study the structure-function relationship.
%I would like to talk about predicting function from structure.
%This would be a negative chapter, since we were not able to predict anything from tractography.
%But, what happens when there's a pathology in the white matter?
%It's affecting brain function, but we cannot precisely predict what since it impedes tractography.
%In that case, we need to do something to infer which bundles are affected.
%We can do multi-atlas stuff.
%Since bundles are related to dmri, we can add dMRI information to the multi-atlas to improve the localization of affected bundles.
%Finally, the structure vs function in the brain does not necessarily always have to be structural connectivity vs tfmri function.
%We can also use microstructure vs cognitive, and microstructure to function (collaboration with vinod)

%\section{Organization}
%I start by making a beautiful introduction to neuroanatomy, because the reader needs to know what is a brain.
%Here we talk about sulci, giri, white matter, gray matter, cellular composition, layers, etc.
%This chapter also talks about brain function, but from an old perspective.
%Then, I move to explain the state of the art of the non-invasive techniques that we're interested in.
%Since the thesis is going to be about brain parcellation, I have to explain why we are interested on it.
%So the next chapter is about well known parcellations: cytho, broadmann areas, desikan, functional... the classical ones.
%Then, I can basically take the paper of Vinod and explain that, even when we subdivide the brain in specific areas, the brain works as a network.
%There should be a big focus on Structural connectivity since it's the main theme of the thesis.
%We start again with why structural connectivity is important.
%Then, we explain again that it's important to divide the brain based on its connectivity, so we know the basic pieces of the brain that work together.
%We present my work (CDMRI + neuroimage), this includes state of the art, and I guess stuff that was made after.
%%In the previous chapter we explained how to divide the brain based on a structural criteria.
%Now, other chapter, we discuss that there's variability in the parcellation of different subjects.
%We insist in the fact that this is ok, because we are all different humans. 
%Then we present the MICCAI paper made in collaboration with Nathalie, this includes state of the art, etc etc etc
%%
%Another chapter, this time about multiatlas.
%%\section{Structure vs Function}
%Finally, something about structure vs function.
%In the intro we explained that structure is important, and that function is driven by function.
%It's time to show that this actually happens, and in which cases.
%We can start talking about Osher and others, however this didn't work for us.
%I think it's important to say it.
%%Gaston????????????
%Then, I can include the final part of my neuroimage, where we show the parcels are functionally specialized.
%Maybe something about the work with Nathalie.
%Stanford stuff goes here I guess
%New experiments.

%\section{Other projects?}
%Stanford vwfa? RTOP? Harvard? No idea...
