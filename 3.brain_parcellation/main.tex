\chapter{Mapping the Brain: A review of the brain divisions}

\section{Overview}
Given the complexity of the brain, a dimentionality reduction is needed to
be able to handle the data. Since its beginning, neuroscience has divided
the brain based on different criteria. This allows to study the brain as a
set of regions that interact, instead of a whole mess of neurons. However,
it's not clear if there's a unique and most important division of the human
brain. Historically, different brain parcellation has been created following
different criteria as anatomy, cellular composition and brain function. In
this work, we make a review of the different type of parcellations that
exist, and explain their advantages, and when to use them.

\section{Introduction}
Subdividing the brain in regions homogeneous respect to some criteria is a
necessary first step of every study in neuroscience. By doing this, it's not
only possible to reduce dimensionality, but also to derive rules more general
than when using the whole brain. How to divide the brain will heavily depend
on the task desired to achieve. Using the wrong parcellation can introduce
a bias in the results. Historically, the brain has been divided following
different criteria. Furthermore, with every new technological advance, new
parcellations arise. Perhaps the first parcellation to exist was the anatomical
one. Still something from Demians thesis here. Based solely in the brain
morphology, gross divisions of the brain can be made, as lobes and etc.

\section{Cythoarquitecture}
Cythoarquitectonic divisions of the brain are based solely in the cellular
composition of the cortex. In this atlases, a brain region possess the same
cells inside of it. The first and most known division is that of Brodmann.
Brodmann divided the brain in XX regions. He showed stuff for humans and
animals. He showed relationship with function.
Von Economo extended this work, and did more stuff. Someone showed that 
in this parcellation, the regions with similar cellular composition tend
to be connected between them.
in my mendeley \cite{Glover2011}.

\section{Anatomical}
Anatomical divisions of the brain are based on the cortical morphology/shape.. check the name.
The most know one is Desikan. Desikan is based on detecting a set of particular
gyris, and then divide the brain based on them. It has XX divisions per
hemisphere, is simmetrical and can be applied in monkeys also, I think.. check it.
This map was further refined by Destrieux. Destrieux works in a similar way,
but makes further subdivisions of giry and stuff. AAL is older than them?
Anyway, no one recomends AAL.

\section{Functional}

Functional subdivisions of the brain create maps of regions functionally 
specialized. This is, each region is in charge of a specific motor/cognitive
function, or is part of a greater system with a specific functional goal.

\subsection{Anatomical + Cythoarchitectural}
The first functional maps where derived from lessions. Lessions in here
determinated that function. Lessions in there determinated another one.
Some activations while torturing cats also showed interesting stuff.

\subsection{EEG}
No idea... i have to read it.

\subsection{fMRI}
With the invention of fMRI, it was possible to measure the level of oxygen
in blood. Knowing that the neurons need oxygen as fuel to fire, we can
find wich region of the brain are being activated for specific tasks.
Even more interesting is the fact that there are some regions that activate
while in a resting state. Here we talk about many of them.

\section{Semantic}
Semantic parcellations try to map semantic processing to the cortex.
In this maps, a region of the brain is ligated to a specific 'definition?/semantic'.

\section{Structural Connectivity}
In a structural parcellation, regions have a homogeneus pattern of connectivity
with the rest of the brain. The first maps come from tracers in monkey. The new
ones come from tractography. Yeah, we know that tractography is not perfect,
but we cannot torture any more monkeys. We name all of the principal players.

\section{Multimodal}
Finally, more and more people is doing this. Maybe a precursor of this is
anatomy+cythoarquitecture. But here we talk about really different modalities,
as T1+T2+fMRI+goodknowswhat. We present at least two. I'm sure there are more.

\section{Discussion}
There's not such a thing as a unique brain parcellation. While we cannot say
that it doesn't exist. We know that all of our techniques have a limitation,
either in resolution, SNR. At the same time, we cannot study things at the
neuron level, because we have billions of neurons in the brain. It makes a
lot of sense that each parcellation is different, because they're based
in different criteria. Even when trying to parcellate data coming from a
same machine (fmri, dmri, etc), changing the hyphotesis will change the 
resulting parcellation. For example, in structural gradient vs structural
parcel. The important thing is to be able to select the right parcellation
for the right study.

\section{Resume of all of the parcellations presented}
Here I put a beautful table resuming everything.
