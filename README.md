# Inferring and Comparing StructuralParcellations of the Human Brainusing Diffusion MRI - Guillermo Gallardo

Understanding how brain connectivity is organized, and how this constrains brain functionality is a key question
of neuroscience. The advent of Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) permitted the in vivo estimation of 
brain axonal connectivity. In this thesis, we leverage these advances in order to: study how the brain connectivity is 
organized; study the relationship between brain connectivity, anatomy, and function; find correspondences between 
structurally-defined regions of different subjects, and infer connectivity in the presence of a brain’s pathology.

This thesis was submitted in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of **Doctor of Science** Specialized in
Control, Signal and Image Processing of the *Université Côte d’Azur*. All the text (latex), images, and svg files of my
thesis can be found in this repo.
