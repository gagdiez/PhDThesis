abstract = {It is generally agreed that the cerebral cortex can be segregated into structurally and functionally distinct areas. Anatomical subdivision of Broca's area has been achieved using different microanatomical criteria, such as cytoarchitecture and distribution of neuroreceptors. However, brain function also strongly depends upon anatomical connectivity, which therefore forms a sensible criterion for the functio-anatomical segregation of cortical areas. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers the opportunity to apply this criterion in the individual living subject. Probabilistic tractographic methods provide excellent means to extract the connectivity signatures from diffusion-weighting MR data sets. The correlations among these signatures may then be used by an automatic clustering method to identify cortical regions with mutually distinct and internally coherent connectivity. We made use of this principle to parcellate Broca's area. As it turned out, 3 subregions are discernible that were identified as putative Brodmann area (BA) 44, BA45, and the deep frontal operculum. These results are discussed in the light of previous evidence from other methods in both human and nonhuman primates. We conclude that plausible results can be achieved by the proposed technique, which cannot be obtained by any other method in vivo. For the first time, there is a possibility to investigate the anatomical subdivision of Broca's area noninvasively in the individual living human subject.},

abstract = {The primary goal of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) is to delineate the typical patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the healthy adult human brain. However, we know that there are important individual differences in such patterns of connectivity, with evidence that this variability is associated with alterations in important cognitive and behavioral variables that affect real world function. The HCP data will be a critical stepping-off point for future studies that will examine how variation in human structural and functional connectivity play a role in adult and pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders that account for a huge amount of public health resources. Thus, the HCP is collecting behavioral measures of a range of motor, sensory, cognitive and emotional processes that will delineate a core set of functions relevant to understanding the relationship between brain connectivity and human behavior. In addition, the HCP is using task-fMRI (tfMRI) to help delineate the relationships between individual differences in the neurobiological substrates of mental processing and both functional and structural connectivity, as well as to help characterize and validate the connectivity analyses to be conducted on the structural and functional connectivity data. This paper describes the logic and rationale behind the development of the behavioral, individual difference, and tfMRI batteries and provides preliminary data on the patterns of activation associated with each of the fMRI tasks, at both group and individual levels.},

This relationship is used to design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e., water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff are ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to determine fiber orientation. Estimation of Deff provides the theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor imaging, which provides information about tissue microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the scalar apparent diffusion constant.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the basic principles governing the diffusion phenomenon and its measurement using magnetic resonance (MR). Diffusion is a mass transport process arising in nature, which results in molecular or particle mixing without requiring bulk motion and magnetic resonance provides a unique opportunity to quantify the diffusional characteristics of a wide range of specimens. Because diffusional processes are influenced by the geometrical structure of the environment, MR can be used to probe the structural environment non-invasively. This is particularly important in studies that involve biological samples in which the characteristic length of the boundaries influencing diffusion are typically so small that they cannot be resolved by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. As water undergoes diffusion, it also encounters barriers, macromolecules, and sampling many different local environments. Collectively, the signal measured in an MR experiment contains contributions from water motion in these various microenvironments. The challenge in diffusion NMR and MRI is to try to infer features of the local tissue anatomy, composition, and microstructure from MR displacement measurements. One great advantage of MR is that it permits one to probe tissue structure at different length scales—i.e. levels of hierarchical architectural organization. Thus, this imaging modality permits to study and elucidate complex structural features spanning length scales ranging from the macromolecular to the macroscopic—without the use of exogenous contrast agents.},

abstract = {Preoperative DTI Fiber Tracking (DTI-FT) reconstruction of functional tracts combined with intraoperative subcortical mapping (ISM) is potentially useful to improve surgical procedures in gliomas located in eloquent areas. Aims of the study are: (1) to evaluate the modifications of fiber trajectory induced by the tumor; (2) to validate preoperative DTI-FT results with intraoperative identification of functional subcortical sites through direct subcortical stimulation; (3) to evaluate the impact of preoperative DTI-FT reconstructions in a neuronavigational setup combined with ISM technique on duration and modalities of surgical procedures, and on functional outcome of the patients. Data are available on 64 patients (52 low-grade and 12 high-grade gliomas). DTI-FT was acquired by a 3-T MR scanner with a single-shot EPI sequence (TR/TE 8986/80 ms, b=1000 s/mm) with gradients applied along 32 non-collinear directions. 3D Fast Field Echo (FFE) T1-weighted imaging (TR/TE 8/4 ms) was performed for anatomic guidance. The corticospinal tract (CST), superior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital and uncinatus fasciculi were reconstructed. Data were transferred to the neuronavigational system. Functional subcortical sites identified during ISM were correlated with fiber tracts depicted by DTI-FT. In high-grade gliomas, DTI-FT depicted tracts mostly at the tumor periphery; in low-grade gliomas, fibers were frequently located inside the tumor mass. There was a high correlation between DTI-FT and ISM (sensitivity for CST=95\%, language tracts=97\%). For a proper reconstruction of the tracts, it was necessary to use a low FA threshold of fiber tracking algorithm and to position additional regions of interest (ROIs). The combination of DTI-FT and ISM decreased the duration of surgery, patient fatigue, and intraoperative seizures. Combination of DTI-FT and ISM allows accurate identification of eloquent fiber tracts and enhances surgical performance and safety maintaining a high rate of functional preservation.},

However, the functional significance of these spontaneous BOLD fluctuations remains poorly understood. By means of 3 T functional MRI, we demonstrate absent cortico-thalamic BOLD functional connectivity (i.e. between posterior cingulate/precuneal cortex and medial thalamus), but preserved cortico-cortical connectivity within the default network in a case of vegetative state (VS) studied 2.5 years following cardio-respiratory arrest, as documented by extensive behavioral and paraclinical assessments. In the VS patient, as in age-matched controls, anticorrelations could also be observed between posterior cingulate/precuneus and a previously identified task-positive cortical network. Both correlations and anticorrelations were significantly reduced in VS as compared to controls. A similar approach in a brain dead patient did not show any such long-distance functional connectivity. We conclude that some slow coherent BOLD fluctuations previously identified in healthy awake human brain can be found in alive but unaware patients, and are thus unlikely to be uniquely due to ongoing modifications of conscious thoughts. Future studies are needed to give a full characterization of default network connectivity in the VS patients population.},

abstract = {THE transport of fluids in porous media is of importance in a wide range of areas, such as oil recovery, heterogeneous catalysis and biological perfusion. The pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR technique has been used for many years to characterize diffusion and flow in such systems1–3. The analogy between NMR measurements in a field gradient and diffraction has been pointed out in the context of NMR imaging4 and, more recently, diffraction-like effects in the PGSE experiment have been discussed for diffusion in both impermeable5 and connected6 structures. The gradient pulse area plays the role of a wavevector, q, which can probe the structure in which the fluid diffuses. Here we report experimental confirmation of these predicted effects from proton NMR studies of a water-saturated, orientationally disordered, loosely packed array of monodisperse polystyrene spheres. The PGSE-NMR experiments may thus be used to provide an indirect, averaged image of the internal structure of porous solids at a resolution higher than that achievable with conventional NMR imaging. This is particularly advantageous for measurements on large samples, as the resolution available with the PGSE method depends only on the available range of gradient pulse amplitude and duration and is unconstrained by the factors determining resolution in conventional NMR imaging.},

abstract = {We propose an integral concept for tractography to describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF) estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions.},

abstract = {Functional imaging studies have shown that certain brain regions, including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

abstract = {We readdress the diffusion tractography problem in a global and probabilistic manner. Instead of tracking through local orientations, we parameterise the connexions between brain regions at a global level, and then infer on global and local parameters simultaneously in a Bayesian framework. This approach offers a number of important benefits. The global nature of the tractography reduces sensitivity to local noise and modelling errors. By constraining tractography to ensure a connexion is found, and then inferring on the exact location of the connexion, we increase the robustness of connectivity-based parcellations, allowing parcellations of connexions that were previously invisible to tractography. The Bayesian framework allows a direct comparison of the evidence for connecting and non-connecting models, to test whether the connexion is supported by the data. Crucially, by explicit parameterisation of the connexion between brain regions, we infer on a parameter that is shared with models of functional connectivity. This model is a first step toward the joint inference on functional and anatomical connectivity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In modern neuroscience there is general agreement t hat brain function relies on networks and that connectivity is therefore of para mount importance for brain function. Accordingly, the delineation of functional brain ar eas on the basis of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and tractography may lead to highly relevant brain maps. Existing methods typically aim to find a predefined number of areas and/or are limited to small regions of grey matter. However, it is in general not likely that a single parcellation dividing the brain into a finite numbe r of areas is an adequate representation of the function-anatomical organizat ion of the brain. In this work, we propose hierarchical clustering as a solution to ov ercome these limitations and achieve whole-brain parcellation. We demonstrate that this method encodes the information of the underlying structure at all granularity levels in a hierarchical tree or dendrogram. We develop an optimal tree building and processing pipeline that reduces the complexity of the tree with minimal information los s. We show how these trees can be used to compare the similarity structure of differe nt subjects or recordings and how to extract parcellations from them. Our novel approach yields a more exhaustive representation of the real underlying structure and successfully tackles the challenge of whole-brain parcellation.},

This relatively new technique has generated much enthusiasm and high expectations because it presently is the only approach available to non-invasively study the three-dimensional architecture of white matter tracts. While there is no doubt that DTI fiber tracking is providing exciting new opportunities to study CNS anatomy, it is very important to understand its limitations. In this review we therefore assess the basic principles and the assumptions that need to be made for each step of the study, including both data acquisition and the elaborate fiber reconstruction algorithms. Special attention is paid to situations where complications may arise, and possible solutions are reviewed. Validation issues and potential future directions and improvements are also discussed.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the theory and practicalities of multiple-comparisons nonparametric randomization and permutation tests for functional neuroimaging experiments and this has been illustrated with worked examples. The permutation approach offers various advantages. The methodology is intuitive, flexible and accessible. While the traditional approach to multiple comparisons controls the family-wise error rate, the chance of any false positives, another perspective has recently been introduced. The new approach controls the false discovery rate (FDR), the fraction of false positives among all detected voxels. This chapter considers the family-wise error rate and proposes permutation approach to FDR. It begins with an introduction to nonparametric permutation testing, reviews experimental design and hypothesis testing issues, and illustrates the theory by considering testing a functional neuroimaging dataset at a single voxel. The problem of searching the brain volume for significant activations is then considered, and the extension of the permutation methods to the multiple-comparisons problem of simultaneously testing at all voxels is described. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The logarithm of the odds ratio (LogOdds) is frequently used in areas such as artificial neural networks, economics, and biology, as an alternative representation of probabilities. Here, we use LogOdds to place probabilistic atlases in a linear vector space. This representation has several useful properties for medical imaging. For example, it not only encodes the shape of multiple anatomical structures but also captures some information concerning uncertainty. We demonstrate that the resulting vector space operations of addition and scalar multiplication have natural probabilistic interpretations. We discuss several examples for placing label maps into the space of LogOdds. First, we relate signed distance maps, a widely used implicit shape representation, to LogOdds and compare it to an alternative that is based on smoothing by spatial Gaussians. We find that the LogOdds approach better preserves shapes in a complex multiple object setting. In the second example, we capture the uncertainty of boundary locations by mapping multiple label maps of the same object into the LogOdds space. Third, we define a framework for non-convex interpolations among atlases that capture different time points in the aging process of a population. We evaluate the accuracy of our representation by generating a deformable shape atlas that captures the variations of anatomical shapes across a population. The deformable atlas is the result of a principal component analysis within the LogOdds space. This atlas is integrated into an existing segmentation approach for MR images. We compare the performance of the resulting implementation in segmenting 20 test cases to a similar approach that uses a more standard shape model that is based on signed distance maps. On this data set, the Bayesian classification model with our new representation outperformed the other approaches in segmenting subcortical structures. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The relationship of the structural integrity of white matter tracts and cortical activity to motor functional outcomes in stroke patients is of particular interest in understanding mechanisms of brain structural and functional changes while recovering from stroke. This study aims to probe these underlying mechanisms using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fMRI measures. We examined the structural integrity of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) using DTI and corticomotor activity using motor-task fMRI in stroke patients who completed up to 15 sessions of rehabilitation therapy using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. We hypothesized that (1) the structural integrity of PLIC and corticomotor activity are affected by stroke; (2) changes in structural integrity and corticomotor activity following BCI intervention are related to motor recovery; (3) there is a potential relationship between structural integrity and corticomotor activity. We found that (1) the ipsilesional PLIC showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values when compared to the contralesional PLIC; (2) lower ipsilesional PLIC-FA values were significantly associated with worse motor outcomes (i.e., ipsilesional PLIC-FA and motor outcomes were positively correlated.); (3) lower ipsilesional PLIC-FA values were significantly associated with greater ipsilesional corticomotor activity during impaired-finger-tapping-task fMRI (i.e., ipsilesional PLIC-FA and ipsilesional corticomotor activity were negatively correlated), with an overall bilateral pattern of corticomotor activity observed; and (4) baseline FA values predicted motor recovery assessed after BCI intervention. These findings suggest that (1) greater vs. lesser microstructural integrity of the ipsilesional PLIC may contribute toward better vs. poor motor recovery respectively in the stroke-affected limb and demand lesser vs. greater cortical activity respectively from the ipsilesional motor cortex; and that (2) PLIC-FA is a promising biomarker in tracking and predicting motor functional recovery in stroke patients receiving BCI intervention.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter fibers. The diffusion tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a voxel. However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple tensor fitting, q-space, and Q-ball imaging. However, each of these has inherent limitations. In this study, we propose a novel method for estimating the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution diffusion-weighted MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations present. We assume that all white matter fiber bundles in the brain share identical diffusion characteristics, thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion anisotropy to partial volume effects. The diffusion-weighted signal attenuation measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the convolution over the sphere of a response function (the diffusion-weighted attenuation profile for a typical fiber bundle) with the fiber orientation density function (ODF). The fiber ODF (the distribution of fiber orientations within the voxel) can therefore be obtained using spherical deconvolution. The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard 1.5-T clinical scanner. The technique can recover the fiber ODF in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as tractography. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform, also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction algorithm are discussed.},
